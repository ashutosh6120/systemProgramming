Silicon Valley is a region in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern
California that serves as a global center for high technology and innovation. It corresponds 
roughly to the geographical Santa Clara Valley. San Jose is Silicon Valley's largest 
city, the third-largest in California, and the tenth-largest in the United States; other major
Silicon Valley cities include Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, Redwood City, Mountain View, Palo Alto,
Menlo Park, and Cupertino. The San Jose Metropolitan Area has the third-highest GDP per capita 
in the world (after Zurich, Switzerland and Oslo, Norway), according to the Brookings Institution.

The Golden Gate is a strait on the west coast of North America that connects San Francisco Bay to the 
Pacific Ocean. It is defined by the headlands of the San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Peninsula, 
and, since 1937, has been spanned by the Golden Gate Bridge. The entire shoreline and adjacent waters 
throughout the strait are managed by the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.

The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the opening of the San Francisco 
Bay onto the Pacific Ocean. As part of both US Highway 101 and California Route 1, it connects the city 
of San Francisco on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County.

The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge span in the world when completed in 1937, and is 
an internationally recognized symbol of San Francisco and California in general. Since its completion, the 
span length has been surpassed by eight other bridges. It still has the second longest suspension bridge 
main span in the United States, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. In 2007, it was ranked 
fifth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.
